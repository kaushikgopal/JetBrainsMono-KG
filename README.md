# Custom version of Jetbrains Mono font

I like Jetbrains Mono font but there are certain characters just don't look good
(to me). Luckily Jetbrains has support for a variety of alternative characters
as part of the
[opentype features](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono?tab=readme-ov-file#opentype-features).

This repo is a script that allows you to customize and install a version of the
font with your preferred alternative characters.

For example, if you run the `make` command it uses `calt,cv10,ss19` features.
